Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-game.git
cd maze-game
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have SDL2 installed:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
Build the project:

bash
Copy code
make
Run the game: Pass a map file as an argument:

bash
Copy code
./maze_game map.txt
The map.txt file should contain a map layout defined by integers or characters that the game engine can interpret to render the maze.

Usage
Once the game is running, the player can navigate through the maze using these controls:

W: Move forward
A: Move left
S: Move backward
D: Move right
To modify or create different maze layouts, simply update the map.txt file or create new map files.

Example map.txt:

Copy code
111111
100001
101101
100001
111111
1 represents walls.
0 represents empty spaces where the player can move.
